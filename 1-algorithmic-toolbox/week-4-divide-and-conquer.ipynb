    "# Linear search\n",
    "- You search an element in an array. You just start from the beginning and try to find it as you go.\n",
    "- If `len(array)` is too long, it'd take too long as well. \n",
    "- Iterate through the array until you find the chosen element. If you reach the end of the array and haven't yet found the element, return NOT_FOUND.\n",
    "- Divide and conquer for linear search: `LinearSearch(Arr, lowBoundary, highBoundary, keyToSearch)`\n",
    "    for each iteration, check if `Arr[lowBoundary]` = `keyToSearch` and if this is false, do another call with `LinearSearch(Arr, lowBoundary+1, highBoundary, keyToSearch)`. Do this until `lowBoundary > highBoundary`.\n",
    "    This is a very subtle divide and conquer algo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recurrence relation\n",
    "- is an equation **recursively** defining a sequence of values\n",
    "- Just like fibonacci\n",
    "- Runtime of linear serach would make it `c * n` where `c` is the constant amount of work done each iteration (recursion)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Binary search\n",
    "- Searching sorted data (like a real dictionary). Imagine \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "- `A[i]` is no more than `A[i+1]` but could be the same. `A` is an array. There could be however duplicates in an array. \n",
    "- This is called monotonic non-decreasing array.\n",
    "- If you cannot find the key in the array, which index would it have been in?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching in a sorted array\n",
    "- Easy. Just return the index where the number would have been in in a sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impl (in a sorted array)\n",
    "- `BinarySearch(Array, lowBoundary, highBoundary, keyToSearch)\n",
    "- You wanna find out the **midpoint**. do `high-low` and divide by `2`. Floor it so that it is not going to be a fraction.\n",
    "- If you find `keyToSearch` equal to `midpoint`, return `midpoint` (the index). You are done.\n",
    "- Else, because it is a sorted array, `if key < A[midpoint]`. recursively call `BinarySearch(Array, lowBoundary, mid - 1, keyToSearch)`\n",
    "- If it's bigger, just change that to `mid + 1`.\n",
    "- What's good here is that you **can ignore the half of the array each time**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We've recursively solved the subproblems. And then we're going to combine the results of those subproblems. We broke the problem into a problem of size half (slightly less than half). We recursively solved that single subproblem and then we combined the result very simply just by returning the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Binary search runtime\n",
    "- recall the binary search algo\n",
    "- recurrence relation for the worst runtime: you don't find the element. \n",
    "- Runtime goes like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "n\n",
    "n/2\n",
    "n/4\n",
    "...\n",
    "2\n",
    "1\n",
    "0\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Seeing top-down, you get `n` broken down by half repeatedly. If you are doing so, it is going to take `log base 2` until you get to 1. \n",
    "- at each level, you are doing a constant amount of work `c`\n",
    "- You can ignore the base because it's anyways a constant work. \n",
    "- You could also have `while` version in contrast to the recursive version. It's essentially the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Real life example\n",
    "- Augmented set of arrays\n",
    "- Use pointers in another array to remember corresponding words\n",
    "- Compare these pointer-containing arrays to find match\n",
    "- Use this method: of course you've got a space-time trade off. But if there were 5000 words, instead of searching for the time of `T(50000)`, you could search in `T(log(50000))` which is about `T(15.x)`. So instead of 50000 references you should make, you can really reduce it down to 15 times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- The runtime of binary search is big theta of `log(n)`. (For reviewing big theta, see [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49880681/time-complexity-understanding-big-theta)). In short, the theta means the worst and the best cases are run in the same time complexity always.\n",

    "# Polynomial multiplications\n",
    "- Usages: multiplying large integers together..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiplying polynomials\n",
    "- You only need coefficients\n",
    "- Just middle school math\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive algo\n",
    "- Just calculate each case one by one in a nested for loop\n"
