    "- A **data structure**, as implied by the name, is a particular structured way of storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.\n",

    "## Computational problems\n",
    "- Algorithms are simply solutions to computational problems. **A single computational problem can have numerous algorithms as solutions.**\n",
    "- For example, for an algorithm to get the largest element in a given array of `int`s, there are hundreds of ways to implement it. \n",

    "- Therefore, **P is a subset of NP**, but [it has not yet been proven that P = NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems#P_versus_NP). => Not all problems in NP can be solved in polynomial time.\n",
    "- Then what's like a problem that's **not a member of P but NP only?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### NP-hard\n",
    "**Nondeterministic Polynomial-time hard**.\n",
    "- A problem can be considered NP-Hard **if it is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP**.\n",
    "- A problem H is NP-Hard when every problem L in NP can be \"reduced,\" or transformed, to problem H in polynomial time. \n",
    "- Example of an NP-hard problem: [subsset sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "### NP-complete\n",
    "**Intersection between NP and NP-hard**.\n",
    "- an NP-Hard problem is considered NP-Complete if it can be verified in polynomial time (i.e., it is also in NP).\n",

    "Knowing the class of a given computational problem, you may expect / save the length of the time you will work on it, or even give up on it because it's simply impossible to finish it in a polynomial time."
