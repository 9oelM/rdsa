    "# ArrayList\n",
    "## Specifications\n",
    "- All elements are of the same type\n",
    "- All elements are stored in adjacent memory locations\n",
    "- The element at index `i` is at memory address `x + bi` => we can access specific element we want very quickly: in O(1) time. (This is called **random access**)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You create an array of integers (assume each integer is exactly 4 bytes) in memory, and the beginning of the array (i.e., the start of the very first cell of the array) happens to be at memory address 1000 (in decimal, not binary). What is the memory address of the start of cell 6 of the array, assuming 0-based indexing (i.e., cell 0 is the first cell of the array)?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "0: 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "1: 1004\n",
    "\n",
    "2: 1008\n",
    "\n",
    "3: 1012\n",
    "\n",
    "4: 1016\n",
    "\n",
    "5: 1020\n",
    "\n",
    "6: `1024`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "- we will assume that a user can only add elements to indices between 0 and n (inclusive), `n = num of total elements that exist in the list prior to the new insertion`\n",
    "- user can only add elements to the front or back of the array (push/pop)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic ArrayList\n",
    "1. allocate some default \"large\" amount of memory initially\n",
    "2. insert elements into this initial array\n",
    "3. once the array is full, they create a new larger array (typically twice as large as the old array), \n",
    "4. copy all elements from the old array into the new array, \n",
    "5. replace any references to the old array with references to the new array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, this is `vector` equivalent. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking challenge\n",
    "```\n",
    "Array structures (e.g. the array, or the Java ArrayList, or the C++ vector, etc.) require that all elements be the same size. However, array structures can contain strings, which can be different lengths (and thus different sizes in memory). How is this possible?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: store pointers to strings in an array. Pointers are of the same size anyways. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Insertion\n",
    "- Worst case: `O(n)` = Inserting into the first index (You have to move up all other elements by one index)\n",
    "- Best case: `O(1)` = Inserting at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary search in ArrayList\n",
    "**Everything is under the assumption that elements are sorted in advance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have the array sorted in advance\n",
    "2. Compare the element in search against the middle element \n",
    "3. If less than the middle element, repeat search on the left half of the array / If more, do it on the right half\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removal\n",
    "- Best case: `O(1)` = remove the end\n",
    "- Worst case: `O(n)` = remove at the beginning (comes from our restriction that all elements in our array must be contiguous)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thinking challenge\n",
    "```\n",
    "When we remove from the very beginning of the backing array of an Array List, even before we move the remaining elements to the left, the remaining elements are all still contiguous, so our restriction is satisfied. Can we do something clever with our implementation to avoid having to perform this move operation when we remove from the very beginning of our list?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: if we were to remove `arr[0]`, set index 1 as index 0, 2 as 1, 3 as 2... and n as n-1 and so on. Then it could be done in `O(1)`. In short: adjust indices. "
